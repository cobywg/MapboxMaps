# Examined area and zoom levels
The examined area I choose was the Seattle area. I choose the zoom levels between 3-8 so it could be uploaded to github. I orginally choose the orginal values of 3-14 and I wasen't able to upload my files to gethub. I choose to keep the zoom levels consistant between each of the layers. The mpas displayed on the website doesn't look as intended because I coulden't use more zoom levels.
